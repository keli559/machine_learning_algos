# French Wind Case Study

In this project, linear regression model is used to predict the French wine according to the parameters associated with the wine. 

This case originated from Edx Analytics Edge class. I expanded it further using octave to calculate the linear regression and the validation of the algorithm.

Please take a look of:

* writeup.md : gives a thorough analysis of the data, regarding the variables, and some exploratory analysis of data.
* ./code/ : provides a detailed octave code to run the linear regression model for this problem.
