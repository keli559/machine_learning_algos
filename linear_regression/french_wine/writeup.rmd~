# Wine Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Synopsis
The data gives the wine prices and other factors. A linear regression analysis is used to predict wine's price. 
## Download Data

```{r, cache=T}
wine = read.csv('wine.csv')
wineTest = read.csv('wine_test.csv')
names(wine)
```
For each elements, a scatter plot is made to show the relation between price and the factor. Both AGST and HarvestRain show the highest influences over the French wine price. 
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
model1 = lm(Price~AGST, data=wine)
with(wine, plot(AGST, Price))
abline(model1)

model1 = lm(Price~HarvestRain, data=wine)
with(wine, plot(HarvestRain, Price))
abline(model1)
```
## Linear Regression

Now consider AGST and HarvestRain both as variables to predict the wine price using linear regression. 

```{r}
model2 = lm(Price~AGST+HarvestRain, data=wine)
predictTest = predict(model2, newdata=wineTest)
summary(model1)
summary(model2)
```
