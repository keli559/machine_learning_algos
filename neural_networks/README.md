# Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called "neural networks" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modelling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables.
