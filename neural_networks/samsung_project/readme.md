# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
## About the Data
The data comes from an experiment to record human activities using smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). In this experiment, there were 30 volunteers wearing the smartphone, while performing 6 activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. The smartphone uses its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, to record the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 HZ.

## Variables


In this project, a two-layer neural network is used to predict the human activity based on the measurements
